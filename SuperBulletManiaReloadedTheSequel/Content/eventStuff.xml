      <Text>According to my analysis, you may be suffering from colourblindness and/or dyslexia. That's okay! Just follow my instructions. Please move your mouse until it is hovering over the button on the left, (that, incidentally, has 'Yes' written on it in large capital letters and is green) and press the left mouse button.</Text>

      <Text>This game is a cross between a tower defense game and a text adventure. On the left, this will play as a classic tower defense game : enemies will spawn and attempt to get to the other end of the map, and if 100 get through, you lose. However, on the right, this text box will contain the description for certain events, and you can answer by either 'Yes' or 'No', which will affect the gameplay of the tower defense. Understood?</Text>

      <Text>The difficulty comes from the fact that you have a limited time to make your choices: if the related text scrolls up to the top of the screen before you can answer, the game will consider that you ignored the person speaking to you, leading to a multitude of (usually negative) consequences. Therefore, as in this case, you need to think fast : should you click on 'Yes', or 'No'?</Text>

      <Text>Ok! Finally, here are the controls: you place turrets by left-clicking a zone where there's space to set one (if of course you have enough money), and switch between turrets with the left and right arrow keys. I would suggest that you place a turret using the 100 units of nondescript money that you currently own, since you'll only gain more by either killing enemies or responding correctly to certain events.</Text>
